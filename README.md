# Covid-Tracker
A simple news app that focuses on COVID-19 news.  Just add an api key from [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/docs/get-started) into the `<INSERT NEWSAPI API KEY HERE>` field on line 52 of `app.tsx`, and run the project to see some recent news!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
